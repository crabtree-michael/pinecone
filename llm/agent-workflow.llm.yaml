basic agent workflow:
  inputs:
    - prompt: 
        description: location of the initial prompt for the LLM within project prompt folder
                      When run the prompt folder should refer to the package prompt directory,
                      not the working directory prompt directory
    - initial context getter: a function that returns the initial context
  steps:
    build initial context:
    replace context in prompt:
      - key: "{initial_context}"
    start chat with $prompt:
    loop:
      - wait for orchestrator message
      - loop for final answer:
        - get chat response 
        - execute tools if requested
        - respond to llm with tool response
      - respond to orchestrator
